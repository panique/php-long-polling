/**
 * Server-side file.
 * This file is an infinitive loop. Seriously.
 * It gets the file data.txt's last-changed timestamp, checks if this is larger than the timestamp of the
 * AJAX-submitted timestamp (time of last ajax request), and if so, it sends back a JSON with the data from
 * data.txt (and a timestamp). If not, it waits for one seconds and then start the next while step.
 *
 * Note: This returns a JSON, containing the content of data.txt and the timestamp of the last data.txt change.
 * This timestamp is used by the client's JavaScript for the next request, so THIS server-side script here only
 * serves new content after the last file change. Sounds weird, but try it out, you'll get into it really fast!
